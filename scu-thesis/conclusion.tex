\section{Lessons Learned}


Another challenge we had to learn to overcome was poor documentation in the third-party libraries we used.  In the course of this project, we had to use many libraries in multiple operating system environments.  Many of these libraries were openly sourced and developed by third-parties.  For example, we used IgniteUI for the design of the web interface, WolfSSL for the secure handshake in the discovery procedure, and OpenSSH for the file transfer.  Unfortunately, most of these libraries had poor documentation, providing very little description as to their usage, and sometimes even giving contradicting information.  The lesson we learned from this challenge was to take into account the difficulty in diciphering the usage of third-party libraries when deciding whether or not to use them.  Furthermore, we learned techniques for deducing the usage of libraries.  For example, some libraries had similar function patterns as common libraries we had all encountered before, allowing us to infer the proper usage.
