Backup systems are an important part of any IT infrastrucutre. They provide
data assurance in the face of faulty hardware and software. Nonetheless,
computer users commonly rely on backup systems that fail to exhibit the
reliability they claim to provide. We work to resolve this issue by creating a
storage device that can communicate and share data with other storage devices
in a secure manner. If data is corrupted on any single storage device, the data
may be restored from a set of other storage devices.
