Backup systems are an important part of any IT infrastrucutre. They provide data assurance in the face of faulty hardware and software. Nonetheless, computer users commonly rely on backup systems that fail to exhibit either reliability, accessibility, security, or a combination of all three. We work to resolve this issue by creating a storage system in which users share encrypted data fragments amongst each other instead of with a single data storage entity. If data is corrupted on any single storage device, the data may be restored from a set of other storage devices.  Furthermore, this data is dispersed geographically. These architectural features of the sytem provide greater reliability and accessibility while the lack of any central service provider allows users to retain ownership of their data, improving privacy.
