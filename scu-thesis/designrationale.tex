\chapter{Design Rationale}
	There are many reasons why we would make our system dual layer.  It makes sense that we have one layer for the client and another for the server box that each user has.  This allows alot of the systems activities to be transparent to the user, because they are happening on the external hardware and not on the user's own PC.  For example, all of the storage space is contained on this external box, as well as most of the distributed sending and receiving.

	Using OpenSSH to communicate between client and server allows the data transfers to be secure, and any listeners on the network should not be able to intercept anything.  The only vulnerable point is when the initial connection is made between the client and the server; however, through secure handshaking spoofing should be avoided.

	We will use MongoDB because it encapsulates and abstracts many common database functions for us, instead of requiring us to develop them ourselves.  It is well known and has been proven to function at a high performance level, with a good storage efficiency.
